# myo-arduino-xcode-inmoovhand

This is a project that uses Myo gesture control band to control a robotic hand (Inmoov).

This project was motivated by a desire to learn about 3D printing, Arduinos, and Myo gesture control armband. The goal was to make the robotic hand that respond to gesture inputs from Myo. The robotic hand serves as a prototype of a prosthetic
human hand, or a robotic hand that can operate for various purposes.

The project involved 3D printing of hand and other parts; assembling the joints with strings attached to servomotors programming the Arduino board so that the robotic hand can decode commands and move the servos correspondingly; utilizing the Myo SDK in Xcode to capture gesture inputs from the Myo and open a serial communication with the Arduino.
